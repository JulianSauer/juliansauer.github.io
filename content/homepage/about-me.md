After completing my bachelor's degree in informatics - software systems at the Westphalian University of Applied Sciences I moved to Dortmund. There I got a M.Sc. in computer science at the Technical University of Dortmund focusing on algorithm engineering and graph drawing.

Since I wrote my bachelor thesis at adesso SE I reentered the company as well as their subsidiary com2m GmbH during my master's degree as a working student and began working full time after finishing it.
